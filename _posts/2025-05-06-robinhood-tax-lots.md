If you're investing through Robinhood, here's a useful new feature you may not have noticed â€” **the ability to choose specific tax lots when selling stocks**.

## ðŸš§ The Old Way: FIFO by Default

Until recently, Robinhood followed the **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** accounting method by default â€” and you had no option to change it.

This meant that when you sold shares of a stock:

- The **oldest shares** (those bought first) were sold first.
- This had significant **tax implications** â€” older shares likely fall under **long-term capital gains** (taxed at a lower rate), while newer ones might be **short-term** (taxed as ordinary income).

### Example:

> You hold 20 shares of a stock:  
> - 10 bought 3 years ago  
> - 10 bought 6 months ago  
>  
> You sell 15 shares â†’ Robinhood would sell:  
> - 10 long-term shares  
> - 5 short-term shares

You had no say in which ones to sell, making tax optimization impossible.

## âœ… The New Way: Choose Specific Tax Lots

Robinhood now allows investors to **select specific lots** when selling, a feature long available in traditional brokerages like Fidelity and Schwab.

This gives you greater control:

- **Minimize tax liability** by choosing long-term lots
- **Harvest losses** by selling specific shares at a loss
- **Strategically manage gains** for tax planning

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

- More control = **better tax efficiency**
- Enables **tax-loss harvesting**
- Makes Robinhood more competitive with advanced platforms
